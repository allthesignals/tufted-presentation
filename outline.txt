      - D3 is a powerful tool, but it's very low level
      - Tufted generalizes common charts and makes them reusable and extensible

FiddleJS:
  - Prepare simple CartoDB datasets
    - tabular
    - then map
    - then complex visualizations
  - Show colors, callouts, other options
  - Extensibility examples
    - Preserves D3 selections

Next steps:
  - Tufted API
  - Integrating C3 code, approach


  Notes: 
  Reusability:
   1. A chart can be instantiated more than once in a given context, each visualizing a different data set.
   2. Chart definitions (source code) can be easily re-factored by other developers to suit their needs.
   3. Chart behavior can be altered at run-time through a consistent API.
   4. New charts can be defined in terms of existing charts.
